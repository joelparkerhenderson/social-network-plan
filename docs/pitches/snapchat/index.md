Snapchat is a messaging app that was launched in 2011 by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown. Users in Snapchat can exchange photos and videos that are 1 to 10 seconds long and called Snaps. There is also the option to send messages, stickers, and stories. All these can be edited with different filters and other tools.

Snapchat’s unique value proposition is that the sent content is available only for a limited time, after which it gets deleted. The time users have to view their messages may vary depending on the message type and the sender’s preference. The creators wanted to imitate real-life interaction where communication happens now with no record of what is being said.

The app had 46 million users at the beginning of 2014 and reached 280 million at the beginning of 2021, as published by Statista. The company also had success in its funding rounds and managed to get $4.9B between its creation and August 2018.

Snapchat used this deck in 2014, but it wasn’t meant for investors. Instead, it promoted the app to various businesses to create accounts and use the platform for advertising. The presentation contains detailed information about the app and how it works. This way, advertisers are familiarized with a new platform and can consider its potential for promoting their business. It also mentions celebrities and companies with Snapchat accounts and points to how they use the service.

As a whole, the deck has an aesthetically pleasing and clean design. Notice that the slides are heavy on text and content. This is acceptable for a long corporate presentation, but it is a big mistake if you are creating a short pitch deck aimed to present your startup.
