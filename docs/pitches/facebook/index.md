Facebook is a social network website that was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004. The service allows users to create profiles, connect with other people (follow their feeds), and share imagery, thoughts, events, and other types of content with their own connections. There’s also the option for chat messaging and audio and video calls. Users can create groups and pages, like and comment on content on the site, etc.

Facebook started as a social network for students in Harvard College, with the idea of adding more colleges and schools and later making a shared network of all USA schools. However, reality surpassed the service creators’ wildest dreams. From about a million users in 2004, the network grew to 2.85B in the first quarter of 2021.

The deck on this page was used to present to investors the potential the service had among students. The plan was to take advantage of the purchasing power college students had in their hands and to grow the enterprise through advertisement – a model that proved hugely successful, making Facebook one of two key players in the digital advertising industry (the other one being Google).

Even though the presentation may look somewhat rudimentary compared to current design trends, it ensured the first funding for the company - $500K from entrepreneur, and PayPal co-founder, Peter Thiel.

Facebook managed to raise $16.1B by October 2014 in 17 rounds, with some of the major investors being DST Global, Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, Elevation Partners, TriplePoint Capital, Horizons Ventures, and more.
