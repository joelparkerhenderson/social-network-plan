# Organizations: for-profit, non-profit, governmental, etc? 


[Issue discussion](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/26)

Discuss organizational structures, such as organizing as a for-profit company, or a non-profit charity, or a governmental project, etc.

## Quotations



## For-profit

Examples: 

* [Facebook](https://facebook.com)

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com)

* [Reddit](https://reddit.com)


## Non-profit

Examples: 

* [Craigslist](https://craigslist.org) is a kind of social network in the sense of helping people post classified ads, search them, and email about them.

* [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org) and [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/). The nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation provides the essential infrastructure for free knowledge. We host Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia, created, edited, and verified by volunteers around the world, as well as many other vital community projects. All of which is made possible thanks to donations from individuals like you. We welcome anyone who shares our vision to join us in collecting and sharing knowledge that fully represents human diversity.

* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) is a kind of social network in the sense of users sharing news stories, ranking them, and posting about them. Similar projects include: [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs) community link aggregation and discussion, [MetaFilter](https://www.metafilter.com) community weblog, [Tildes](https://tildes.net) non-profit open-source link-aggregator, etc.

Non-profit approaches could include, for example:

* Extend an existing non-profit, such as Craigslist or Wikimedia, to add more kinds of social network capabilties.

* Create a new non-profit that creates a new social network, such as to foster public use, potential akin to The [Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS). PBS is a nonprofit organization and the most prominent provider of educational television programming to public television stations in the United States. PBS is funded by member station dues, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, corporate contributions, National Datacast, pledge drives, private foundations, and individual citizens. All proposed funding for programming is subject to a set of standards to ensure the program is free of influence from the funding source.

Quotations:

* "The current approach to social network sites -- specifically the dependence on venture capital and advertising -- makes companies chase goals that are harmful for the users themselves."

* "I believe that a non-profit model is the only way to break out of the current cycle of sites starting out as "too good to be true" (as they burn through their VC), and inevitably devolving into privacy-invading, advertising-heavy sites dominated by lowest-common-denominator content when they need to keep forcing growth and monetize their users."


## Governmental

Examples: TODO

Governmental approaches could include, for example:

* Government grants for existing social networks and/or their providers, such as via direct leadership by the [United States Department of State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State) or one of its bureaus such as the [Bureau_of_Educational_and_Cultural_Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Educational_and_Cultural_Affairs).

* Goverment stimulation of research and development, such as for "big picture solutions", something akin to the [DARPA Grand Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge)

* Government creation of a independent agency, something akin to the [National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Endowment_for_the_Arts). NEA is an independent agency of the United States federal government that offers support and funding for projects exhibiting artistic excellence.


Quotations about trust:

* "A centralized government funded social network just sounds like a terrible idea. I cannot imagine trusting that."

* "The absolute last thing we need is government-funded social media. If YouTube "spreads propaganda," what do you expect from a platform that a massive government has its hands directly on? It's as dystopian-sounding as any idea I have ever heard."

* "The worry about government censorship isn't as strong as you think. The U.S. government, unlike a private corporation, can't legally engage in viewpoint-based censorship."

Quotations about abuse:

* "Trolls and abusive behaviors thrive on for-profit social platforms in part because at some level the platforms don’t mind this.
They'd thrive even more on a government-funded platform which is legally obligated not to censor their speech."

* "At the core, you'd still have 4chan/8chan, because that's what 'public access' (and 'free speech') means. And while it is very valuable, a lot of people just can't properly digest it."

Quotations about legislation:

* "The European solution here is to legislate our way to that end goal, whereas the "market" way is to make something that's appealing that gets you most of what you liked about the centralized service, but with more control over your data."

* "The route is tough here, whatever the technological solution. People don't believe Facebook is as bad as it is, even when Facebook admits they are to their faces. So whatever we're talking about here, it realistically only comes about after Facebook is ordered to break up or stop trading."

* "Part of censure of the megacorps should be forcing them to use open federated standards or face steep repercussions."

Quotations about approaches:

* "We need universities to research social networks, not just the CS departments but also human sciences, so we get something that actually benefits us and society. Let companies provide the hardware, and let government agencies run the software just like in the old days of the internet. No company should ever see or touch any of the data."

* "I would say it needs to be more like BBC with a funding stream that isn't dependent on government approval."

* "As someone running a Mastodon server out of her own pocket (with some help from enough of her users that it’s not too bad), I certainly wouldn’t mind if there was some kind of government funding available to help out on that."

Quotations about features:

* "If you took a combination of Facebook, Nextdoor, and PBS, removed all commercial interests, made it publicly owned, and made its mission the betterment of the public good, yes, that would actually be amazing. Citizens could communicate among themselves, either in "neighborhood groups", or privately.

* "Government entities could publish data that citizens could subscribe to, such as community classes at the local library, parks department announcing a call for volunteers, DMV office closings, IRS filing deadlines, local civic board meeting notes, and of course, PBS content. It could be one source to consume all of the potential open data available to citizens. It could also be a portal to find the right government services, as well as pass information to it: report a crime, pothole, zoning violation, etc much like '311 apps' do today (e.g. [Philadelphia 311](https://www.phila.gov/311/form/Pages/default.aspx), [Open Maps Philly](https://openmaps.phila.gov/), [Open Data Philly](https://www.opendataphilly.org/), [Philly Property History](https://li.phila.gov/), [Philly Atlas](https://atlas.phila.gov/)).

* "Why will people use a governmental social network? Can I get news updates? Can I find funny/entertaining content? Can I reasonably expect organic engagement, and potential virality? Can I get private life updates from my friends, without the government's eyes peering in? People don't typically go to PBS for most of these things (news is one thing they do), so I can't imagine how a "PBS" for social media would be very different."
