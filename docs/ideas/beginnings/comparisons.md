# Comparisons: similarities & differences versus others?

[Issue discussion](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/4)

Discuss comparisons, similarities, and differences versus other social networks and other social network plans.


## Quotations

Quotations to consider:

* "The social startups that have struck it big in the post-Facebook era have all started by carving out a different niche. That difference can’t just be about a site’s back-end architecture or business model, as with Diaspora (an open-source Facebook) or App.net (a Twitter without ads). The product itself has to fulfill a fresh purpose for its users, like sharing snazzy smartphone snapshots (Instagram), networking and advancing their careers (LinkedIn), or showing off their taste in fashion, food, and design (Pinterest)."

* "The problem with Facebook is that it holds way too much personal information about a person - phone numbers, emails, a person's likes/dislikes, hometown, current location, etc, and because society has been 'programmed' to share so much about themselves, no thanks to social networks like Facebook that promotes building your 'profile'. In fact, strip away all that personal information and have people share their thoughts and their dinner photos and what you get is just Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat or a blogging platform."

## Example ideas

Example ideas from real people to consider:

Similarities to many existing social networks:

* I want a profile photo, like on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.
* I want to post an item, such as a status update, or photo, or link.
* I want to find events, schedule meetings, buy tickets, etc.

Differences from many existing social networks:

* I want multiple profiles, such as personal and professional.
* I want multiple names, such as my birth name and my fame name.
* I want multiple facets, such as a facet for each of my groups.
* I want multiple genders, such as when I transition male to female.
* I want to use a pseudeonym, not my real name.
* I want transparency, such as knowing who's viewing me, when, where.
* I want ways to engage more locally, e.g. like NextDoor.
* I want to promote my small business to neighbors.
* I want features that help me do my side-hustles.

Versus Twitter:

* I want a longer username, not limited to 15-characters.
* I want long posts.

Versus Facebook:

* I want separation e.g. peers vs. news, work vs. home, family vs. friends.
* I want a pin area so I can feature my current interests e.g. links to music.
* I want to share with groups of people e.g. circles.
* I want more ways to shape my feed, e.g. more photos of friends, fewer photos of food.
* I want fewer ads and/or more-relevant ads.

Versus LinkedIn:

* I want to be able to apply for jobs more easily.
* I want to feature my skills, rather than feature my resume or CV.
* I want to follow company news, yet not get overwhelmed.
* I want to automatically connect to all my coworkers e.g. enterprise address book.

Versus Meetup:

* I want to connect my events to other services.
* I want to share more media, such as event videocasts.
* I want to host private events just for my organization.
* I want to host events with a specialized attendee workflow.


## Brands

"Facebook is brandable, Diaspora - I'm still not sure I pronounce it properly. App.net was a good attempt, a little more brandable than Diaspora - at least with technologists, however not necessarily consumer-friendly; their mission and fight, similarly to how Evan from Snapchat pushed back against what was essentially Mark bullying (sell to me or we'll copy you); ~7 years ago I wrote a blog post after Fred Wilson suggested I turn a comment into its own post, related to The Independent Web - and the requirement that that will require sharing, which means not being greedy, and not trying to capture 100% of value."


### Personal websites

See https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18725413

We should replace Facebook with personal websites. Personal websites will allow Facebook to no longer be irreplaceable, which is the real reason why people stay on the platform. The question isn't whether personal websites can replace Facebook, but whether personal websites will allow room for a real Facebook competitor (which improves the passive consumption experience) to grow.
