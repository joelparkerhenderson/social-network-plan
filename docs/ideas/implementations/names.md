# Names: real names, fake names, no names?

[Issue discussion](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/5)

Discuss names, such as whether a user should be required to use their real name, or can optionally use a fake name or pseudonym, or can optionally use an anonymous name such as a random token.


### Quotations

Quotations to consider:

* "We want people to know who they are connecting to, and we want you to have an authentic experience. So we require you to use your real name, as it would be listed on your credit card, government ID, workplace ID, or student ID."

* "Some people like to use fake names and pseudonyms. These are good for established alter-egos, such as people with pen names. These are also good for people who may need to protect themselves because they may be targets of persecution."

* "Real name policies are unreliable, impossible to enforce correctly, and disproportionally cause problems for ethnic groups and people with unusual names, multiple names, or cross-cultural names."
