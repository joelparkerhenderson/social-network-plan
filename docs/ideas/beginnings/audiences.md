# Audiences: general public, niches, special interests?

[Issue discussion](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/2)

Discuss ideas for audiences, such as the general public, or niche groups, or special needs of people.


## Quotations

Quotations to consider:

* "The social startups that have struck it big in the post-Facebook era have all started by carving out a different niche. That difference can’t just be about a site’s back-end architecture or business model, as with Diaspora (an open-source Facebook) or App.net (a Twitter without ads). The product itself has to fulfill a fresh purpose for its users, like sharing snazzy smartphone snapshots (Instagram), networking and advancing their careers (LinkedIn), or showing off their taste in fashion, food, and design (Pinterest)."


## General public

General public means the widest-possible audience appeal.


## Niches and special interests

Discuss possible niches and special interests for starting a new social network.

Feedback on any of these are welcome, and more ideas are very welcome.


### Topic-based

E.g. music:

* Music sharing spreads very well e.g. via creators, promoters, playliist sites.
* Music involves many areas e.g. people, bands, clubs, promoters, events, tickets.
* Many people have many opinions and multiple reasons to share.
* Many people love ongoing engagement and also love new discovery.
* Easy to bootstrap e.g. via public data, wikipedia, existing sites.
* Easy to focus geographically on major U.S. cities e.g. LA then NY.
* Similar approaches can be considered for movies, television, etc.


### Affiliation-based

E.g. causes:

* Causes can be political e.g. candidates, campaigns, legistations, votes.
* Causes can involve idenity e.g. Black Lives Matter, Pride, Moms Demand Action.
* Causes can involve people e.g. activists, organizers, volunteers, donors.
* Causes can involve outreaches e.g. mailers, promotions, events, surveys.
* Causes can involve locations e.g. local, regional, national, worldwide.
* Easy to bootstrap e.g. via existing cause organzations and social groups.
* Easy to promote e.g. via existing cause leaders, participants, reporters.


### Activity-based

E.g. meets:

* Meets, such as Meetup.com,
* Meets involve many areas e.g. attendees, hosts, locations, events, tickets.
* Many people want real-world interaction, and enjoy going to local events together.
* Meets can also be done online, such as gaming events, Twitch, YouTube live, etc.
* Meets can be of many kinds, such as professional, personal, hobby-based, etc.
* Easy to bootstrap, especially if there's a partnership with an events company.


### Location-based

E.g. malls:

* Malls tend to have anchor positions in many cities and towns, at least in the U.S.
* Malls involve many areas e.g. shoppers, stores, brands, coupons, sales.
* Malls are widely understood, and coupons have an immediate value prop.
* Easy to bootstrap, especially if there's a partnership with mall group.
* Easy to focus geographically on specific cities and then grow larger.


### Integration-based

E.g. mashups:

* Mashups can interconnect multiple existing sites, to create a new kind of site.
* Mashups can be more akin to open intergrations, less akin to closed walled gardens.
* Potentially great to bootstrap, by connecting two or more useful sites.
* Easy to focus on the users of the initial mashup sites, and these users' goals.
