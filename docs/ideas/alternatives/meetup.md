### Meetabit

Meetabit is a Meetup.com alternative aimed at technical meetups. We built it at Toughbyte.

I organize a number of technical meetups, such as HelsinkiJS which is the biggest developer meetup in Finland, and have found Meetup.com lacking. To scratch our own itch, we built Meetabit which includes some additional features such as the ability to accept talk proposals and sponsorship offers, have speaker profiles, archive of talks and related materials, export data etc.

It does what we need and we haven't been actively developing or promoting it recently, but it has still grown organically to around 10K users and multiple meetups organized each month. We are likely to put more resources into it given the recent changes at Meetup.com. Worth adding that the service is free both to organizers and attendees; our long term plan is to have the same business model as Stack Overflow by promoting relevant jobs to members.


### Guestboard

We've been cranking away at a better group event/planning platform on https://guestboard.co for a while now (basically Slack meets Evite), but with this news, we're switching up our product roadmap to include recurring events much sooner. Would love the input from any/all. Possibly considering an interim solution of simply cloning an existing event and carrying over the guest list from previous?

We'll also be prioritizing a "discovery" search tool to be able to find public events without needing to encounter an invite link from an organizer.


### Mixily.com

https:://Mixily.com

I'm building Mixily.com as a general event-organizing tool. Like an alternative to FB events, but with better styling, features, and privacy policy. It launched in July and works great for one-off events.

For recurring events, we have some features in private beta, like pre-set guest lists and a forum. Email me at andrew@mixily.com if you want to try it out!


### Chapter by freeCodeCamp

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-wework-meetup-debacle-and-a-new-chapter/

Project: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/chapter

Announcement: https://twitter.com/ossia/status/1183845054449930241

I've spent the past 2 years looking for a good alternative for the dozens of freeCodeCamp study groups that are hosted on Meetup.com.

There are only two platforms that can give your group and your events comparable exposure: Facebook and Eventbrite.

Facebook has a "Groups" functionality that allows you to create events and allows people in your group to RSVP for them. It's free. And most people already have a Facebook account, even though fewer people use Facebook these days. The problem with Facebook is it's hard to actually reach people - even inside your own Facebook group. You could have thousands of people in your Facebook group and only a few hundred of them will see your event when you post it. You can of course pay Facebook to advertise your event. That's probably way cheaper than using Meetup.

Eventbrite is good, and is free for free events. It is less useful for groups with regular events.

And there are several functional clones of meetup.com as well - some of which are open source. But none of these have much critical mass. Most of them are littered with groups created by people who were just tinkering, and events rarely get RSVPs - let alone actually happen.

The fundamental problem with these platforms is they aren't associated with any specific organization. They don't have a specific stakeholder raising awareness of the events. These are big, general social network-like tools where anyone can create any type of event and make it public to everyone.

The good news is I've spent the past two years thinking about this problem. And there's a way we can get organizations onboard to bring their own networks. The solution is to let every organization host their own "Meetup.com in a box." They can house this on their own servers. They can host this on their own website. And they can steer their own existing community to their own chapters' events. This will give each organization full ownership and full control over their data. It will also let them configure the tool however best suits their chapters.


### Bailiwik

Bailiwik helps people turn the places they care about into communities that connect online and off. Our app puts local connectors at the center: they define their community on the map, they name it, they design it and they play a leading role in the shared community chat room. Community members chat with each other, share events, enjoy deals from local merchants -- and live richer and more fun lives as a result. We strive to empower leaders to cultivate inclusive communities of connection, collaboration, and kindness.


### Kickback

I helped build Kickback (https://kickback.events/), an Ethereum-based platform which aims to reduce event no-shows. Essentially speaking, each attendee commits a small amount of money (e.g. $10) when they RSVP. If they turn up they get their money back. If they don't show up their money gets split amongst those who did. The money handling is secure, transparent and automated via a smart contract running on Ethereum.

(Most recently we did 13 small events at the Devcon5 conference in Osaka and got an overall average turn-up rate of ~80% on Kickback).

If we're building an alternative to meetup.com how about integrating with platforms like Kickback and/or incorporating such features?

You can even use our smart contracts directly: (https://github.com/wearekickback/contracts).


## Opportunities


### How to discover events?

Comments:

By [jborichevskiy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jborichevskiy)

Somewhat related note: as someone living in a major city I find it increasingly hard to discover relevant events happening soon/around me.

Events I'm looking for span a range of interests, artists, bands, topics, hobbies, and causes - hence no one central location has a list of everything relevant to me. So I'm forced to regularly dig through Meetup, Eventbrite, Facebook, Google Events Search, individual sites, individual web pages, AXS, Spotify Concerts, email newsletters, etc.

Building another event organization platform isn't the solution - getting people, venues, and organizers onto it would be an expensive uphill battle, and would further fracture discovery. But a thought of a decentralized open-source aggregation of a bunch of feeds has been popping up in my mind lately. These could be sourced from all of the above mentioned sources and somewhat standardized into a format with name, description, price, location, time. From there, it should be a simple matter to add filtering, subscriptions, and even a recommendations engine.

Has anything like this been attempted? Might it work? I haven't found anything yet.


### Aggregation tool vs. aggregatable data

Claim: "We strongly need some aggregating tool for all events happening around a particular location."

No, and looking for tools (or Portals as they are groaningly called) is where the Web went wrong. We need strongly aggregatable data, not a tool. In fact this data format already exists in schema.org, which is an open, community-driven effort by Google, Bing, Yandex and others. https://schema.org/Event

schema.org is used by about a third of web sites to allow them to be self contained but make their information discoverable and reusable in a precise way, and it is the skeleton of the much-promised semantic web. The main factors working against it are Facebook and Amazon, who have enough mass and selfishness to want to be self-contained worlds.

That is the only reasonable way to "decentralize" this data so anyone can use it. Add your recognized sites once (or perhaps have a recurring crawl) and anyone can have their own feed of events, just like RSS. It's just that developers and startups don't like the boring work of following standards, they'd rather build a tool.


### RSS with microformats

An aggregatable data approach is called RSS with microformats. This is exactly where the web was in what, 2004?

Part of censuring Big Tech should be forcing them to adopt open standards, XMPP, RSS, Microformats, etc.
