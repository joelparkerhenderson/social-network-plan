# Scopes: benefits, features, minimum viable product?

[Issue discussion](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/3)

Discuss ideas for scopes, such as benefits and features, and what's needed for a minimum viable product.


### Quotations

Quotations to consider:

* "What features and benefits are necessary to get someone to try a new social network? What can we build as directly as possible, to try our plan right now?"

* "Facebook has the most valuable triumvirate of requirements for a successful service: a huge audience, an huge pile of money, and huge group of smart employees. The result is a social network funded by advertising and virtual goods. They are, in a very real sense, the ultimate example of the minimum viable product: there is nothing there. Peek behind the curtain and the social network is held up only by its connections."

## Minimum Viable Product

We believe that to be successful, the best path is to create the simplest-possible social network that people will actually use. This is a minimum viable product (MVP).


### Yes, likely in scope

Capabilities that we believe must be in scope:
* Join: e.g. sign up, sign in, sign out, manage your data, delete your account
* Post: e.g. with a combination of title, text, link, image
* Wall: e.g. a profile page, news feed, timeline, calendar
* Item: e.g. a person, place, event, organization


### Maybe, possibly in scope

Capabilities that we like, yet don't know if they must be in scope:
* Mark: e.g. like, love, star, upvote, downvote, flag, tag
* Blob: e.g. photo, video, audio, document
* Team: e.g. group, circle, room, forum, channel, categories
* Chat: e.g. comment, message, mail


### No, not in scope

Capabilities that we expect to defer to future scope:
* Mobile apps
* Old browsers
* Live streams
* Notifications
* Payments
* Account portability
* Fine-grained access control e.g. private messages
* Fine-grained server networking e.g. LAN neighborhoods
