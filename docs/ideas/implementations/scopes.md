# Scopes: benefits, features, minimum viable product?

[Issue discussion](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/3)

Discuss ideas for scopes, such as benefits and features, and what's needed for a minimum viable product.


## Quotations

Quotations to consider:

* "What features and benefits are necessary to get someone to try a new social network? What can we build as directly as possible, to try our plan right now?"

* "Facebook has the most valuable triumvirate of requirements for a successful service: a huge audience, an huge pile of money, and huge group of smart employees. The result is a social network funded by advertising and virtual goods. They are, in a very real sense, the ultimate example of the minimum viable product: there is nothing there. Peek behind the curtain and the social network is held up only by its connections."

## Minimum Viable Product

We believe that to be successful, the best path is to create the simplest-possible social network that people will actually use. This is a minimum viable product (MVP).


### Yes, definitely in MVP scope

Capabilities that we believe must be in MVP scope:

* Join: e.g. sign up, sign in, sign out, manage your data, delete your account - a.k.a. authenticate, authorize, audit, abort.

* Item: e.g. a person, place, thing, event, organization - a.k.a. data content with create, read, update, delete.

* Find: e.g. simple search by text, location, timespan


### Maybe, possibly in MVP scope

Capabilities that we like and want in MVP scope if reasonable:

* Wall: e.g. a profile page, news feed, calendar timeline

* Mark: e.g. like, love, star, flag, tag, rsvp, vote

* Post: e.g. with a combination of title, text, link, image

* Blob: e.g. photo, video, audio, document

* Team: e.g. group, circle, room, forum, channel, categories

* Chat: e.g. comment, message, mail, review

* Admin: e.g. audit/manage, approve/reject, flag/triage, censor/ban


### No, defer past MVP scope

Capabilities that we expect to defer to after MVP scope:

* Mobile apps

* Old browsers

* Live streams

* Notifications

* Integrations: APIs, feeds, pub/sub, RSS/Atom/ActivityPub, vCard/vCalendar

* Commerce: shopping, payments, coupons, coins, advertisements, promotions

* Distributed, federated

* Account portability

* Meta-editing: revisioning, composting, coalescing, gardening, teaming

* Fine-grained access control e.g. private messages

* Fine-grained server networking e.g. LAN neighborhoods


### Software quality attributes

* Accessibility: e.g. vision assistance, keyboard navigation, WCAG 2.1 AAA criteria

* Personalizability: e.g. internationalization, localization, personal pronouns

* Responsibility: e.g. code of conduct, member guidelines, dispute handling
